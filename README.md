# Hydra_LIF_GAPnoGAP_net

This is a model of LIF neuron network coupled by excitatory synapses. Neurons have long refractory period, allowing to avoid the
synchronous reverberatory activity. In a certain parameter regime there this network has a stable and global (across the whole network) 
activity propagation.
